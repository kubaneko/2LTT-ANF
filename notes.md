Required transformations

ANF requires name generation while evaluating?

VApp f - if f is VLam or VGlob then we transform to VApp Join newName f

We propagate Joins,Lets up

When we get VApp f u and u is not Atomic we let-bind it

We need to track number of arguments in Intermediate representation of Jump - if we get to another decrement it.
